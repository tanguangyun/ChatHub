As a result, only the Trafic (8.0L/100km) and the Transit Custom (7.1L/100km) claim sharper economy figures.\n\nComing standard with air conditioning, a two-speaker stereo, daytime running lights and 16-inch steel wheels, the entry-level automatic Transporter TDI340 misses out on the Bluetooth connectivity included on the Toyota, \u301026\u2020Hyundai\u3011, \u301044\u2020Mercedes-Benz\u3011, Ford and Renault offerings.\n\nObtaining cruise control \u2013 standard on Vito, Transit Custom, Trafic and V80 \u2013 also requires a further $490.\n\nOnce settled into the narrow and flat but still comfortable vinyl-winged cloth seat base and gripping the soft-rimmed button-free steering wheel, the Transporter isn\u2019t a bad place to be.\n\nA little utilitarian among a sea of hard-wearing dash and door trims, manual climate controls and a basic audio unit, the scratchy yet durable centre console, air vents, grab handles and plastic floor liner are all offset by one-touch driver and passenger power windows (up and down), damped indicator and wipers stalks, and Volkswagen\u2019s standard clear and simple instrument layout.\n\n### Get a great deal today \n\nInterested in this car?

Happy to complete most tasks asked of it below 2000rpm \u2013 including freeway stretches at 100km/h \u2013 the grunty turbo diesel delivers sound cruising pace from as low as 1600rpm until things noticeably drop off around 4400rpm. It\u2019ll even contently coast along at 60km/h doing 1400rpm in fifth gear.\n\nProne to some hesitation and jerkiness when responding to sporadic prods of the throttle in stop-start traffic situations, the DSG gearbox and its dash-mounted gear selector work well overall, delivering smooth ratio swaps once moving, with little to no interruption to drive.\n\nAnnoyingly, though, the transmission\u2019s own gear indicator \u2013 located on the left-hand side of the selector\u2019s base \u2013 is obstructed from the driver\u2019s view by the DSG-stamped gear lever itself. A slight ergonomic oversight, the issue can be easily circumvented by relying on the gear display in the instrument cluster, which sits next to the time and above outside temperature, trip and fuel information.\n\nShifting goods is what the Transporter\u2019s all about, though, and despite being shorter in length than the iLoad, Transit Custom and V80, the 4892mm-long Volkswagen\u2019s 5800L load volume is only bettered by the HiAce (6000L) and V80 (6400L).\n\nThe Volkswagen Transporter\u2019s 1268kg payload rating is also the pick of the bunch, while its 2000kg braked towing capacity can only be matched by the Vito and Trafic and topped by the Ford at 2500kg.\n\nSliding back the heavy passenger side door presents an area 2353mm long and 1692mm wide at its maximum. Slightly reduced due to our test van being fitted with a $690 mesh cargo barrier, the Transporter\u2019s rear end space still offers plenty of stacking room thanks to its 1410mm floor-to-roof height and 1244mm minimum width (between rear wheel guards).\n\nProviding excellent head clearance at 1305mm tall, the weighty 1486mm-wide tailgate creates a large aperture for loading items through, although some may find the six floor-mounted tie-down hooks more of a nuisance than convenient.\n\nOddly too, the Volkswagen Transporter is free of any side or roof strapping/tie-down points.\n\nAnd while the tailgate gives drivers an uninterrupted view out the back \u2013 rather than a thick join line common to barn door-style rear doors \u2013 lower rear vision is made much more difficult, particularly when reverse parking.\n\nBut where a rear-view camera is standard on the HiAce, Transporter buyers looking to match the Toyota need to fit not only a $2490 sat-nav unit but additionally a $1890 package that includes front and rear parking sensors ($890) and a rear-view camera, for a total of $4380.\n\nFortunately, the standard heated power side mirrors provide excellent assistance and rear parking sensors on their own will only set you back $490.\n\nStandard on the Mercedes-Benz Vito and Hyundai iLoad, a driver\u2019s side sliding door is also an option on the Volkswagen Transporter, priced at $1190.\n\nA driver and front passenger airbag, stability control and hill-start assist are all standard fair, and the German van is also covered under Volkswagen\u2019s three-year/unlimited kilometre warranty with three years 24hr roadside assist.\n\nWith capped-price services ranging from $435 to $508 over the first three 15,000km annual service intervals, the first three years of ownership in the Volkswagen Transporter TDI340 DSG will cost you $1577.\n\nBetween $530 and $377 dearer than servicing costs over the same time period for the iLoad, Trafic and Transit Custom \u2013 the latter including brake fluid replacement \u2013 only Volkswagen declares costs for replacing both the pollen filter and brake fluid (both required every two years).\n\nWith service intervals every 10,000km, however, the Toyota HiAce \u2013 with two services annually \u2013 still takes the crown, requiring $1020 over three years or 60,000km.\n\n",

              "The fuel consumption of a Volkswagen Transporter can vary based on the specific model and driving conditions. For example, the 2021 Volkswagen Transporter T6.1 L2H1 2.0 TDI 110HP, which is one of the recent models, doesn't have its fuel consumption data explicitly mentioned in the sources I found. However, a review of a Volkswagen Transporter model, which is equipped with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo diesel engine and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, mentions a combined cycle fuel consumption figure of 8.2 litres per 100km. It's important to note that this figure might vary, especially when the vehicle is carrying eight people, as more weight can lead to increased fuel consumption.\n\nFor more detailed information, you might need to refer to the specific model's manual or contact a Volkswagen dealer. Also, keep in mind that real-world fuel consumption can be influenced by factors such as driving style, road conditions, and maintenance of the vehicle\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30107\u2020source\u3011."

As a result, only the Trafic (8.0L/100km) and the Transit Custom (7.1L/100km) claim sharper economy figures.\n\nComing standard with air conditioning, a two-speaker stereo, daytime running lights and 16-inch steel wheels, the entry-level automatic Transporter TDI340 misses out on the Bluetooth connectivity included on the Toyota, \u301026\u2020Hyundai\u3011, \u301044\u2020Mercedes-Benz\u3011, Ford and Renault offerings.\n\nObtaining cruise control \u2013 standard on Vito, Transit Custom, Trafic and V80 \u2013 also requires a further $490.\n\nOnce settled into the narrow and flat but still comfortable vinyl-winged cloth seat base and gripping the soft-rimmed button-free steering wheel, the Transporter isn\u2019t a bad place to be.\n\nA little utilitarian among a sea of hard-wearing dash and door trims, manual climate controls and a basic audio unit, the scratchy yet durable centre console, air vents, grab handles and plastic floor liner are all offset by one-touch driver and passenger power windows (up and down), damped indicator and wipers stalks, and Volkswagen\u2019s standard clear and simple instrument layout.\n\n### Get a great deal today \n\nInterested in this car?

Happy to complete most tasks asked of it below 2000rpm \u2013 including freeway stretches at 100km/h \u2013 the grunty turbo diesel delivers sound cruising pace from as low as 1600rpm until things noticeably drop off around 4400rpm. It\u2019ll even contently coast along at 60km/h doing 1400rpm in fifth gear.\n\nProne to some hesitation and jerkiness when responding to sporadic prods of the throttle in stop-start traffic situations, the DSG gearbox and its dash-mounted gear selector work well overall, delivering smooth ratio swaps once moving, with little to no interruption to drive.\n\nAnnoyingly, though, the transmission\u2019s own gear indicator \u2013 located on the left-hand side of the selector\u2019s base \u2013 is obstructed from the driver\u2019s view by the DSG-stamped gear lever itself. A slight ergonomic oversight, the issue can be easily circumvented by relying on the gear display in the instrument cluster, which sits next to the time and above outside temperature, trip and fuel information.\n\nShifting goods is what the Transporter\u2019s all about, though, and despite being shorter in length than the iLoad, Transit Custom and V80, the 4892mm-long Volkswagen\u2019s 5800L load volume is only bettered by the HiAce (6000L) and V80 (6400L).\n\nThe Volkswagen Transporter\u2019s 1268kg payload rating is also the pick of the bunch, while its 2000kg braked towing capacity can only be matched by the Vito and Trafic and topped by the Ford at 2500kg.\n\nSliding back the heavy passenger side door presents an area 2353mm long and 1692mm wide at its maximum. Slightly reduced due to our test van being fitted with a $690 mesh cargo barrier, the Transporter\u2019s rear end space still offers plenty of stacking room thanks to its 1410mm floor-to-roof height and 1244mm minimum width (between rear wheel guards).\n\nProviding excellent head clearance at 1305mm tall, the weighty 1486mm-wide tailgate creates a large aperture for loading items through, although some may find the six floor-mounted tie-down hooks more of a nuisance than convenient.\n\nOddly too, the Volkswagen Transporter is free of any side or roof strapping/tie-down points.\n\nAnd while the tailgate gives drivers an uninterrupted view out the back \u2013 rather than a thick join line common to barn door-style rear doors \u2013 lower rear vision is made much more difficult, particularly when reverse parking.\n\nBut where a rear-view camera is standard on the HiAce, Transporter buyers looking to match the Toyota need to fit not only a $2490 sat-nav unit but additionally a $1890 package that includes front and rear parking sensors ($890) and a rear-view camera, for a total of $4380.\n\nFortunately, the standard heated power side mirrors provide excellent assistance and rear parking sensors on their own will only set you back $490.\n\nStandard on the Mercedes-Benz Vito and Hyundai iLoad, a driver\u2019s side sliding door is also an option on the Volkswagen Transporter, priced at $1190.\n\nA driver and front passenger airbag, stability control and hill-start assist are all standard fair, and the German van is also covered under Volkswagen\u2019s three-year/unlimited kilometre warranty with three years 24hr roadside assist.\n\nWith capped-price services ranging from $435 to $508 over the first three 15,000km annual service intervals, the first three years of ownership in the Volkswagen Transporter TDI340 DSG will cost you $1577.\n\nBetween $530 and $377 dearer than servicing costs over the same time period for the iLoad, Trafic and Transit Custom \u2013 the latter including brake fluid replacement \u2013 only Volkswagen declares costs for replacing both the pollen filter and brake fluid (both required every two years).\n\nWith service intervals every 10,000km, however, the Toyota HiAce \u2013 with two services annually \u2013 still takes the crown, requiring $1020 over three years or 60,000km.\n\n",

              "To find the point where all intervals intersect, you need to determine the common overlap region among all the intervals. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_intersection(intervals):\n    # Sort intervals based on the start point\n    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Initialize the result with the first interval\n    result_start, result_end = intervals[0]\n\n    # Iterate through the sorted intervals and find the common overlap\n    for interval_start, interval_end in intervals[1:]:\n        # If the current interval is within the current result interval\n        if interval_start <= result_end:\n            result_start = max(result_start, interval_start)\n            result_end = min(result_end, interval_end)\n        else:\n            # No overlap found, return None\n            return None\n\n    # Return the common overlap region\n    return result_start, result_end\n\n# Example intervals\nintervals = [[2, 5], [4, 5], [3, 7]]\n\n# Find the intersection\nintersection = find_intersection(intervals)\n\nif intersection:\n    print(f\"The intersection point is: {intersection[0]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"There is no common intersection point.\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `find_intersection` function takes a list of intervals as input. It sorts the intervals based on their start points and then iterates through the sorted intervals to find the common overlap region. If there is a common overlap, it returns the start and end points of the overlap. If there is no common overlap, it returns `None`. In the given example, the output will be:\n\n```\nThe intersection point is: 4\n```"
